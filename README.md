# ESP8266 Textile Automation

## Overview

The **ESP8266 Textile Automation** project is designed to monitor and control textile machinery in an industrial environment. The project leverages the **ESP8266**, a low-cost Wi-Fi module, to provide an IoT solution for textile machines, helping reduce operational costs while increasing efficiency.

The system is designed to monitor the machine's status (whether it's running or idle) based on its **machine angle** and **movement**. This information is sent over a network to a central monitoring system for real-time updates.

Since this is part of a company project, some data and design details are confidential. However, the project showcases the implementation of the ESP8266 in an industrial IoT environment to automate the monitoring and control processes in the textile industry.

### Key Features

- **ESP8266**: Low-cost Wi-Fi module that connects the textile machinery to the cloud or a local monitoring system.
- **Machine Monitoring**: Measures the **machine angle** and detects its **movement** to determine if the machine is running.
- **Real-Time Data**: Sends real-time machine status data (running or idle) to a central system over Wi-Fi.
- **Cost Reduction**: Uses ESP8266 to lower the overall system cost while providing an efficient IoT solution.
- **Confidential Implementation**: The detailed hardware design, programming, and system data are confidential due to the proprietary nature of the project.

## System Components

1. **ESP8266 Module**: The core of the system, enabling Wi-Fi communication and data transmission.
2. **Sensors**: Used to detect the **machine angle** and **movement** of the textile machine.
3. **Power Supply**: Provides the necessary power for the ESP8266 module and sensors.
4. **PCBA Design**: Custom PCB design created for the system to ensure reliable operation in an industrial environment.
5. **Machine Interface**: Interfaces with the textile machine to monitor its operational status.

## Features in Detail

### 1. **ESP8266 Wi-Fi Communication**
The ESP8266 is utilized to send real-time data from the textile machine to a remote monitoring system. By using Wi-Fi, it ensures low-cost communication without the need for additional wired infrastructure. This enables easy scalability for large-scale textile facilities.

### 2. **Machine Status Monitoring**
Sensors are integrated to measure:
- **Machine Angle**: Detects the position of the machine, ensuring it is running or idle.
- **Machine Movement**: Detects the machineâ€™s movement to track its operational status.

These sensor readings are processed by the ESP8266, which then determines whether the machine is actively running or not.

### 3. **Real-Time Data Transmission**
Data collected by the sensors is sent via Wi-Fi to a central monitoring system. The system receives real-time updates on the machine's status, allowing operators to monitor the health and performance of the machines remotely.

### 4. **Cost-Efficient Design**
By utilizing the **ESP8266**, a cost-effective microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi, the overall system cost is significantly reduced compared to traditional wired solutions. This makes the automation system more accessible for small to medium-sized textile manufacturers.

### 5. **Custom PCB Design**
The **PCB design** is custom-made to support the hardware and ensure seamless integration with the textile machinery. The design also includes necessary components for power management, signal processing, and Wi-Fi communication.

## Hardware and Software Components

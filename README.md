2. **Sensors**: Monitor the **machine angle** and **movement** to determine if the textile machine is running or idle.
3. **PCB Design**: Custom-designed PCB with integrated components for power management, sensors, and Wi-Fi communication.
4. **Power Supply**: Ensures stable and reliable power for the ESP8266 and connected peripherals.
5. **Communication Protocols**: The system uses **FTP** for file synchronization and **MQTT** for real-time communication.
6. **Relays/Actuators**: Control systems such as motor operation and provide alerts based on machine status.
7. **External Hardware Integration**: Supports additional sensors and actuators as needed for more complex machine monitoring.

## Features in Detail

### 1. **ESP8266 for IoT**
The **ESP8266** microcontroller serves as the core of the system, offering the following:
- Wi-Fi capabilities for seamless communication over networks.
- Cost-effective solution suitable for large-scale deployments in industrial automation.

### 2. **Machine Status Monitoring**
The **ESP8266** works with external sensors to determine the machine's operational state:
- **Machine Angle**: Sensors track the machine's angle to determine its position.
- **Machine Movement**: Movement detection indicates whether the machine is running or idle.
- The collected data is transmitted to a central system for real-time monitoring.

### 3. **Remote System Configuration**
The system is capable of remote configuration, allowing operators to:
- Adjust settings remotely.
- Monitor the machine’s operational status.
- Diagnose potential issues without physical interaction.

Configuration is done via **cloud-based platforms** or **local servers**, making management easier and more efficient.

### 4. **OTA Firmware Updates**
The **ESP8266** supports **OTA (Over-The-Air)** updates, allowing remote firmware upgrades without needing direct access to the hardware. This feature is critical for maintaining software updates and improving functionality across all deployed devices.

### 5. **FTP for File Transfer**
The system uses **FTP** to synchronize files between the device and a server:
- Data logs, configuration files, and sensor data can be transferred to remote servers for backup and analysis.
- FTP is used to download configuration updates or other necessary files to the ESP8266.

### 6. **Offline Data Storage**
In the event of network failure, the **ESP8266** can store critical data locally in **EEPROM** or **SPIFFS** (SPI Flash File System). Once the network is restored, the stored data is uploaded to the central server or cloud for processing.

### 7. **Communication Protocols**
- **MQTT**: Ensures real-time communication of machine status data to a central system.
- **FTP**: Used for file transfer, data synchronization, and backup.
